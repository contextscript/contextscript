# Saving and Publishing Context Scripts

Saving a context script will only make it available on your account.
Publishing will make the context script available to everyone. However, 
the script must go through the review queue before it is published.
These are some preliminary guidelines for writing context scripts below.
If a script is modified after it is published the changes will only be
visible to the author. For modifications to be published the script will
have to go through the review queue again.

### Guidelines for writing context scripts

 * Interact with the context script client through the ctxscript variable.
 * Load external libraries from jspm.io via System.import
 * Respect the user.

If you would like to add a guideline, submit a pull request on this file.
